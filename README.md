# Crazy Clothes Shop

The customer wants an online store to sell his products.

## Getting Started 🚀

Due to the early birth of the project, for the moment it will only be necessary to execute it in the cells where the Jupyter Notebook methods have been instantiated.

### Prerequisites 📋

No prerequisites

### Installing 🔧

1. You must download the VS Code application if you do not already have it. Simply run the installer once you have it.

You can download it from here:
(https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

2. Be sure to install the Phyton extension from the VS Code library.

## Running the tests ⚙️

You only need to execute the cells. You will find one with all instances and method calls in the second cell after the code.

You will see that there are already results displayed, but you can always delete them and start them again to see for yourself.
